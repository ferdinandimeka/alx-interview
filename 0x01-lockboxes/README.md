To determine if all the boxes can be opened, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to traverse through the boxes and track the visited boxes. Starting with the first box (index 0), we will add its keys to a queue and continue to visit unvisited boxes while marking them as visited.
In this implementation, we use a boolean list visited to keep track of whether a box is visited or not. We start from the first box (index 0), mark it as visited, and add it to the queue. Then, we perform BFS by popping a box from the queue, checking its keys, and adding unvisited keys to the queue while marking them as visited. The function returns True if all the boxes are visited (unlocked) and False otherwise.
